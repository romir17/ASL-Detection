## ASL Detection

The main goal of this project is to provide a medium of communication between disabled people who use sign language to communicate & people who won't understand sign language.

This project aims to reduce the gap between communication of two people using different mediums to share thoughts with each other

## tflite

tflite is Flutter plugin for accessing TensorFlow Lite API. Supports image classification, object detection (SSD and YOLO), Pix2Pix and Deeplab and PoseNet on both iOS and Android.

## Performance of the App

Althought the app is still in development & testing, we manage to achieve high accuracy on prediciting letter if image is choosen from gallery. While the detection is real time i.e directly from the camera, the accuracy reduces in certain conditions & high accuracy can be achieved if given suffucient time to cool down.
